Design an algorithm that will prompt the user for three letters, receive those letters as input, 
    sort them into ascending sequence and display them to the monitor		

	
	ALGORITHM : compare each letters and sort by ascending order 
	
	===================================
	INPUT : String firstL, secondL, thirdL

	PROCESSING STEPS : compare firstL and secondL and change by ascending order 
	                   and then compare thirdL to firstL and also compare to thirdL to secondL

	OUTPUTS : all three letters by ascending order

	=================================
	PSEUDOCODE : Initialize String firstL to null
	             Initialize String secondL to null
				 Initialize String thirdL to null
				 Initialize String temp to null
	             Prompt user input a first letter
				 Get firstL
				 prompt user input a second letter
				 if second letter is same to first letter
				    prompt user to input another letter
				 Get secondL
				 prompt user input a third letter
				 if third letter is same to first letter or second letter
				    prompt user to input another letter
				 Get thirdL
				 
				 IF (firstL is greater than secondL)
					 THEN
					   temp = firstL
					   firstL = secondL
					   secondL = temp
					   IF( FirstL is greater than thirdL)
					   THEN
							  temp = firstL
							  firstL = thirdL
							  thirdL = temp
							  IF (secondL is greater than thirdL)
							  THEN
									temp = secondL
									secondL = thirdL
									thirdL = temp
							  ENDIF
						ENDIF
					   ELSE 
					   IF ( secondL is greater than thirdL)
					   THEN
							  temp = secondL
							  secondL = thirdL
							  thirdL = temp
					   ENDIF
					
			     ELSE
				 IF ( firstL is greater than thirdL)
				 THEN 
					temp = firstL
					firstL=thirdL
					thirdL=temp
				 ELSE
				 IF (secondL is greater than thirdL)
				 THEN
				    temp = secondL
					secondL = thirdL
					thirdL=temp
				
				Diaplay firstL, secondL, thirdL

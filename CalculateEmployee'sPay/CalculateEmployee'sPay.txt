A program is required by a company to read an employee’s number, pay rate and the number of hours worked 
in a week. The program is then to validate the pay rate field and the hours worked field and, if valid, compute 
the employee’s weekly pay and then print it and the input data.

Validation: According to the company’s rules, the maximum hours an employee can work per week is 60 hours, 
and the maximum hourly rate is $25.00 per hour. If the hours worked field or the hourly rate field is out of range, 
the input data and an appropriate message are to be printed and the employee’s weekly pay is not to be calculated.

Weekly pay calculation: Weekly pay is calculated as hours worked times pay rate. If more than 35 hours are worked, 
payment for the overtime hours worked is calculated at time-and-a-half.
	
    ALGORITHM : compute the employee's pay and display 
	
	===================================
	INPUT : int employeeNum, payRate, workedHour

	PROCESSING STEPS : workedHour*payRate 
	                   If workedHour is greater than 35: calculate 35*payRate+(workedHour-35)*1.5*payRate

	OUTPUTS : employee's weekly pay

	=================================
	PSEUDOCODE : Initialize int employeeNum to zero
	             Initialize double payRate to zero
				 Initialize int workedHour to zero
				 Initialize double weeklyPay to zero

	             Prompt user input employeeNum, payRate, and workedHour
				 Get name	
				 Prompt user input payRate
				 if payRate is greater than 25 or less than 0
				    display original input and prompt to user input valid payRate
				 Get payRate
				 Prompt user input workedHour
				 if workedHour is greater than 60 or less than 0
				    display original input and prompt to user input valid workedHour
				 Get payRate
		
			     if workedHour > 35
				    weeklyPay=35*payRate+(workedHour-35)*1.5*payRate
				 else
				    weeklyPay=workedHour*payRate 
					
				 Display weeklyPay, employeeNum, payRate, workedHour
